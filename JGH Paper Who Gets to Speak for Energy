Title: Who Gets to Speak for Energy? The World Energy Council as a Spokesorganisation for the 'Global Energy Economy' (1924-1990)

Abstract: This article explores the history of the World Energy Council (WEC, formerly World Power Conference and World Energy Conference) between 1924 and 1990 against the backdrop of an emerging field of energy politics. Drawing on the concept of technocratic internationalism, it argues that this international non-governmental organisation exerted influence on the creation of an international statistical and regulatory infrastructure that established this field. Decades before a comparative view on resources as 'energies' was institutionalized in national politics, the WEC promoted this perspective as serving a global public –  the 'global energy economy'. When intergovernmental organisations finally took on this view in the 1950s and again in the 1970s, the WEC continued to serve as a platform for these international organisations, national energy agencies, and large energy companies.

I. Introduction




II. Engineering 'Natural Forces'

III. Founding a platform for the global power economy

The World Energy Council (WEC) grew out of an techno-internationalist spirit that was highly skeptical of national politics. This non-governmental international organisation was founded by Daniel N. Dunlop, a British electro-technical engineer with an inclination for anthroposophical ideas. He had already played a role in the creation of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers' Association (BEAMA) in 1911. Then, in 1924, he summoned all "practical men, scientists, engineers, manufacturers, financiers and politicians” to the first World Energy Conference in London.3 Initially, he had hoped to set up a World Economic Conference.4  For Dunlop, the 'World Economy' was an emphatic expression and a humanist project to be pursued against all national politics. However, such a project appeared to be a forlorn hope in the years after World War I:  

“I could see clearly that it was impossible to bring together politicians, and as all the important economic decisions are in the hands of politicians, it was hopeless to found an international economic body as a first step. But it was possible to bring together human beings in the field of technical questions (...).”5

Hence he set out to do what came closest to his original idea: create an organisation that would study the natural foundation of all things economic. Questions of power transcended national problems just like energy spilled over national boundaries.6 Initiated by an electrotechnical engineer, the WEC stressed its political and industrial neutrality. Neither a nation, nor any single industry should prevail in the organisation. Akira Iriye's observation that the international organisations of the 1920s shared an interest to “earnestly (...) work together to solve problems that faced the whole world”7 holds true for the WEC as well. Questions of power resources seemed to be the most urgent. Representing neither governments nor a specific industry, the WEC purported to be a neutral spokesorganisation for the 'global power economy'. But what can that mean?
