This folder lists, documents, and systematizes the conference proceedings of the World Energy Council (WEC, formerly World Power Conference, World Energy Conference) to make them accessible for historical research. The WEC has been a platform for power and energy specialists since 1924, making for a unique archive of energy history. The folder complements an article on "The World Energy Council as an Archive vor Energy History" in the Journal of Energy History (December 2019 forthcoming). 

The folder consists of a table, listing all WEC conference proceedings, their date, location, general theme, and a short summary of the contents. Other documents, such as scanned table of contents and an index of persons, will gradually be added. As the WEC proceedings are usually documented poorly in libraries, the table can be used as a 'finding aid' to identify relevant material for a given research interest.
